What is the value data type and reference data type in c# ?
Ans)

VALUE TYPE
A data type is a value type if it holds a data value within its own memory space. It means the variables of
 these data types directly contain values.

All the value types derive from System.ValueType, which in-turn, derives from System.Object.
For example, consider integer variable int i = 100;

The system stores 100 in the memory space allocated for the variable i. 
The following data types are all of value type:
bool  byte  char  decimal  double  enum  float  int
long  sbyte  short  struct  uint   ulong  ushort

REFERENCE TYPE
Unlike value types, a reference type doesn't store its value directly. 
Instead, it stores the address where the value is being stored. 
In other words, a reference type contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the data.

The followings are reference type data types:
String  Arrays   Class  Delegate
